# Task-Manager
This project uses an adj list with a graph that initially has one node "A". 

Each time a task is added, a weighted edge connected to a neighbor is added.

weights represent the number of days left while nodes represent the tasks.

A min heap is used to sort through the weights of the graph to order them in a priority list.

This WebApp uses flask (Backend) along with HTML and CSS (Frontend).
