# Task-Manager
This project uses an adj list with a graph that initially has one node "A". 
Each time a task is added, a weighted edge connected to a neighbor is added.
weights represent the number of days left while nodes represent the tasks.
A min heap is used to sort through the weights of the graph to order them in a priority list.
